# InteractDemos

A collection of demos using the Julia Interact package.

## Set up locally

Before I set up this on some server, you can try it locally. Clone the repository, install the relevant packages:

`] add WebSockets WebIO Interact Widgets UnicodePlots CSV DataFrames`

and then run:

`include("main.jl")`

from within the InteractDemos directory. You can see the site at `0.0.0.0:8081` in your browser.
